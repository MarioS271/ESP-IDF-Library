# ESP-IDF-Library

This repository contains all my custom ESP-IDF libraries, types and so on that I've written so far.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The libraries/helpers/types are all written in C++, so you will likely need to write your main in C++ too.
> This can be done using `extern "C"` infront of your `app_main()` declaration.

### Folder Structure:
* `libraries` - Contains full libraries useful for many projects
* `helpers` - Contains helper/wrapper functions for frequently used code
* `types` - Contains custom written types
